To access Oracle, type:

sqlplus xxx@pici-ssc-phenome-dev-db.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu:1521/ORCL‚Äù (replace xxx with your user name).  You will be prompted for your password.

You will be required to change your Oracle password on first use.  Users will often use the same password as for i2b2/tranSMART, but this is not required.
